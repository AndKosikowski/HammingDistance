# HammingDistance
A simple program for finding unique hamming distance paths in a linear graph of n edges.

Inside out/artifacts/HammingDistance_jar is a jar file that can be run to execute the program.

The command for running the jar is "java -jar HammingDistance.jar <Number of Edges You Want Goes Here>"
  
Just run the command in the directory the jar is in.
  
This will show mirrored paths so it will produce twice as many as there actually are.
